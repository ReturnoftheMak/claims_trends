# claims_trends
 Identify keywords that appear across multiple claims over time


## Development
From HC, can we see the amount of claims which have a particular peril.
For me, I think we should probably use this to check docosoft peril codes,
and then use the verified data.

Not sure how I can determine proximate cause with logic over a classifier, but
I don't have a labelled dataset yet.
