Adding Res Class is slightly different, as we want the highest terms per class so we ideally get a different class
dataframe for each, can store this in a dict, and populate the charts based on the df which gets chosen
by passing the key from the class filter.

a dictionary for each set of dataframes?



Changing the loss location data, tricky due to poor data quality
